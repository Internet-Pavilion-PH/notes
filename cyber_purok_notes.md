The Internet Pavilion started as a way to extend our art practices beyond the traditional confines of making and exhibition. At first we even struggled to build a simple HTML page but along the way we found many collaborators who helped and guided us, and tools have become more helpful and accessible. While this exploration centers on the internet, we are glad the project has extended beyond screens. In 2024 we had an exhibition at Anima Art Space; in March 2025 we presented (0,0,0) at Vinyl on Vinyl; and in July 2025 we participated in a show at Gravity Art Space.

Going forward, we will call the project "Low Bandwidth Dreams." Our focus is not primarily on producing outputs, products, or features, but on exploration, experimentation, and learning. Low Bandwidth Dreams will be an online, peer-to-peer exploratory project — perhaps the real art is the journey itself. The name "Low Bandwidth Dreams" was suggested by Franco Mamaril and voted on by the participants. It reflects the fact that more than half of the participants currently live in rural areas where communication infrastructure is not as robust as in cities: frequent brownouts, weak signals, and data-capped internet are common. We are also using free-tier servers with limited storage, renewal cycle of domain is annual, and the ephemerality of technologies and its topics many become obsolete in less than a year, some to extent even just months. 

Because of these constraints, we are setting a yearlong timeframe for this iteration so we have time to edit, enhance, and revise our work. The works in progress of the works can be viewed at https://lowbandwidthdreams.com and we are planning to produce a printable and downloadable catalog.

In this iteration, we will explore:

- **How can our individual, distinct projects be interconnected and amplify each other?**

Since October 2025 we have had regular online meetups and informal gatherings. We believe we learn by doing and by making mistakes. Low Bandwidth Dreams will center its exploration on the concept of a Cyber_Purok and will use prompts, questions, and possible projects as starting points.

This line of inquiry is headed by Salawaki, assisted by KoloWn.
Cyber_Purok is situated in a globalized, fragmented internet era, but it attempts to reappropriate the last remnants of humane relationships that might remain in rural puroks. Can bayanihan, alayon, and cooperation be practiced on GitHub, Google Workspace, and other tools used by working communities?

A purok spot map of traditional rural cottages could help us understand the general layout and relationships within purok households as a whole. In the era of metaverse research, real-time games, open worlds, and games such as Fortnite, Dota 2, and Mobile Legends, we are reminded to “always look at the map.” Advanced mapping tools allow us to zoom into tiny street details or step back to study the bigger picture and its interconnections. Could the same approach help us see how global phenomena — corruption, populism, war, crisis, and pandemics — are connected? Instead of treating these issues separately, might they be interlinked and share common roots? We do not answer those questions in this project — our emphasis is technical rather than political or philosophical — but we can borrow a line from a fictional warlord: Naruto, who said, “I learned from experience.”


- **How can artists take skills and inspiration from tech workers to develop collaborative practices?**

Currently we are exploring tools such as Git and GitHub for collaboration. An online workshop facilitated by Bea Mariano on Git and GitHub ran last October. There will be more experiments in harnessing collaborative workflows for art-making and exhibition that we can test during this period.
We are also using existing tools that are already familiar to other collaborators, such as Google Sheets for Luyo_Space's plant database, Telegram for communications, and Google Meet for online workshops. 

- **How can we use open-source tools to craft tactile works for offline communities?**

Power Plant is a project by Luyo_Space documenting local plants and their medicinal uses. Low Bandwidth Dreams will help produce a zine using free web tools. We will also publish a Low Bandwidth Dreams catalogue using the same method at the end of the project (Oct 2026).

The physical purok cottages often function as reading centers. The Power Plant project by Luyo_Space is inspired by that: instead of reproducing ready-made publications such as “Ang mga kahibulungang Pang-Ayo sa Tanom,” the project starts by documenting the plants available in the immediate locality.

- **How can we explore the internet beyond the limits of a screen?**

When people hear the word “internet” they often think of web browsers, social media, memes, and cat pics. But the internet is bigger — it includes non-pixel-based systems and hardware. Roan Alvarez is heading this exploration, assisted by KoloWn. They will develop the GhostWhisper_dropcall and Aninipot projects during this iteration.

GhostWhisper and Aninipot draw inspiration from the lights and sounds of DIY disco and sound systems (common in some rural purok areas) and from the megaphones used during strikes and rallies in cities. Is it possible for those megaphones to be controlled collectively rather than by a single person?


- **How can we use the internet to amplify our voices?**

Panawagan Banner is a project by Gab Ferrer. Chismis (rumor) and internet protocols both circulate information and disinformation; how can we extend those mechanisms to address real-world problems, for example in Gab Ferrer’s Panawagan Banner project?
*to-do: expound more about this project*

- **How can we use available tools to critique the internet itself?**

The Yellow Basket project, headed by Franco Mamaril, critiques the absurdity and overproduction of online shops (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop, etc.). While these platforms offer convenience compared to traditional sari-sari stores, they also introduce problems such as scams, price manipulation, shopping addiction, plastic pollution, and more.
