## Basic Guidelines for Participants
- All decisions are made by vote; there is no central curator or organizer. Voting power is determined by contributions (highest = 2, lowest = 1).
- Sharing and collaboration are essential; we want to counter the closed and individualistic nature of the art scene.
- All code should be open source. We encourage using Git and GitHub for collaboration.
- This is not a permanent organization; we will disband after the project duration.Whether there will be another iteration depends on the group and its new explorations.
- Everyone is free to leave at any time, fork the code and projects, and we welcome contributions in any form.
- Many of us have day jobs, family responsibilities, and art practices; we value any form of contribution (design, code, review, writing, editing, etc.).
- If money is involved, transactions should be transparent.
