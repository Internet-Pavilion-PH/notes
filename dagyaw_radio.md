**Dagyaw_Radio**

Dagyaw is a Visayan word used in Hiligaynon and Cebuano that connotes cooperation or working together, similar to bayanihan in Tagalog. In some Visayan communities it refers to an individual's contribution to the whole.

Dagyaw Radio takes inspiration from this idea: small contributions of voice clips, field recordings, interviews, generative sound, text-to-speech, and music compositions are collaged by artists or by The Ghost_Whisper System into a 30‑minute radio show.

Dagyaw_Radio is broadcasted on the Ghost_Whisper installation at the ESC Biennale and on other Ghost_Whisper installations, including the Thailand Biennale and various public interventions.
