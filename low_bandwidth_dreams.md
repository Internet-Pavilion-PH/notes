## guidelines
- All decisions are decided by votes, with no central curator/organizer, and voting power is determined by your contributions. The highest is 2 and the lowest is 1.
- Sharing and collaboration is the essence; we want to break from the closed and individualistic nature of the art scene.
- All codes should be open-source and we encourage using Git and GitHub for collaborations.
- This is not a permanent organization and we should disband after our project duration, which is a maximum of one year.
- After a year, it is up to us to determine our individual priorities if we build another iteration. - - Everyone is also free to leave whenever they want. We also welcome anyone who wants to contribute in any form.
- Many of us have  dayjobs, family and art practice, we value any form of contribution from design, code, review, writing, editing, etc.
- If money is involved, it should be transparent.
