**DRAFT**

Moving forward, the Internet Pavilion will be called *Low Bandwidth Dreams*. The title was suggested by Franco and received the most votes in the messenger poll. The aim of the Low Bandwidth Dreams remains the same: to explore the internet as a space and its protocol as a medium within the context of contemporary art in the Philippines.

*Low Bandwidth Dreams* will be part of the 2025 ESC Biennale. The main curatorial concept for the 2025 iteration of the ESC Biennale is "Tambay"; we will return to this topic to produce a dedicated text.

For the Low Bandwidth Dreams ESC Biennale we will explore the concept of "Cyber Purok" as a metaphor for gathering spaces in the virtual world. We will examine how individual projects could be interconnected and how to make internet art beyond the confines of web browsers.

With that in mind, the projects for Low Bandwidth Dreams are:

Browser-based:
- Cyber_Purok by Salawakii (Davao / Dumaguete) — will create a virtual 3D map inspired by a purok household map. The map will feature the current projects and will serve as the main landing page.
- Yellow Basket by Franco Mamaril (Laguna) — will create a fake online store as a critique of the oversaturation of online shopping.
- SMS by Gab Ferrer (Dumaguete) — explores text-based works and how they can transcend from chat-based platforms to web and physical spaces.
- PowePlant by Luyo_Space (Bogo) — a crowdsourced local plant-indexing project.

Internet of Things:
- GhostWhisper by Roan Alvarez and KoloWn — the second iteration will explore internet radio.
- Climaglow Escolta by Rhaz Oriente — a data- and light-based project.

Server-based:
- Ghost_Protocol by KoloWn — will integrate the communication protocols used in this iteration.
