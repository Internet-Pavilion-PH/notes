*Low Bandwidth Dreams* is an online, peer-to-peer study group that explores the internet as both medium and space in the context of contemporary art. It is the successor of the Philippine Islands Internet Pavilion (2020, 2024, 2025).

Duration: October 2025 — October 2026

In this iteration, we will explore:
- How can artists take skills and inspiration from tech workers to develop collaborative practices? (GitHub)
- How can we explore the internet beyond the limits of a screen? (GhostWhisper, Aninipot)
- How can we use open-source tools to craft tactile works for offline communities? (Power Plant)
- How can we use the internet to amplify our voices? (Panawagan Banner, GhostWhisper)
- How can we use available tools to critique the internet itself? (Yellow Basket)
- How can our individual, distinct projects be interconnected and amplify each other? (Cyber_Purok)

## Basic Guidelines for Participants
- All decisions are made by vote; there is no central curator or organizer. Voting power is determined by contributions (highest = 2, lowest = 1).
- Sharing and collaboration are essential; we want to counter the closed and individualistic nature of the art scene.
- All code should be open source. We encourage using Git and GitHub for collaboration.
- This is not a permanent organization; we will disband after the project duration.Whether there will be another iteration depends on the group and its new explorations.
- Everyone is free to leave at any time, fork the code and projects, and we welcome contributions in any form.
- Many of us have day jobs, family responsibilities, and art practices; we value any form of contribution (design, code, review, writing, editing, etc.).
- If money is involved, transactions should be transparent.
