**Gab Ferrer** (b. 1993) is currently based in Valencia, Negros Oriental, and works as a kindergarten teacher at Tikarol Waldorf Homeschool. Her art practice does not always involve making material work — she has recently explored pedagogical art, where teaching and guiding children is considered part of her art practice. Before teaching, she made and sold tinapa (smoked fish). When not sidetracked by errands and other interests, she works in her room like writing in diary pages — often reflecting on where she is and what she's doing, paying close attention to ordinary things.
